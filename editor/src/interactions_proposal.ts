// Should we be limiting the scope here to only interactions that can update the project itself?
// If yes, what are the implications of the model? Do we need to maintain InputState?
// - Yes

// Does something have to have a lifecycle for it to be considered an interaction
// - no consensus here, but it doesn't block us

// Should we be separating keyboard and mouse interactions?
// What would separting them mean?
// What would be the benefit of this vs 1 combined interaction state?
// 1. An interaction can be started be either a key press or a mouse down
//   - keyboard interactions don't use the mouse in any way
//   - mouse interactions don't use the keyboard in any way other than modifier keys present on mouse events

// Do we desire interactions that are tweaked by a keyboard modifier that isn't cmd, shift, alt, ctrl?
// - likely not inside strategies (we could want them for making changes to the editor "mode", or chosen strategy)

// TODO
// - [X] Update accumulatedCommands
// - [X] Check fitness functions and apply chosen strategy in the dispatch function
//       removing the editorStatePatch from the TransientCanvasState
// - [X] Apply the strategies to the patched editor to get the new patch
// - [X] Implement shouldKeepCommands
// - [ ] Support natural handovers when a specific strategy was chosen (e.g. move then reparent)

// - [X] Check available strategies on each render(?) and render their controls in the canvas controls layer
// - [X] Make sure it actually works once applyCanvasStrategy is fixed

// - [X] Use patched editor for rendering the canvas, rather than the transient canvas state
//       Transient state being null results in some optimisations that we need to check for here (or possibly the drag state)

// - [X] Track the strategy being applied
// - [ ] Need to store some state to bridge across changes in a strategy - e.g. individual segments in a drag (which prop you are changing)
//       We already have a solution for this in SelectModeCanvasSessionState

// - [X] Need to actually end the sessions (we create and update the sessions but don't ever close them out)
// - [X] When closing the session we either apply the non-transient updates only, OR cancel the session which bins the commands

// - [ ] Insertion lives in the drag state

  // The latest strategy might want to replace the last commands based on the reason
  // e.g. a continuous drag would be continuously updating the commands that it is generating

  // Alternatively, the InteractionSession could include the currently active strategy, which the apply function could check
  // _or_ the current active strategy is used to determine if the strategy has changed - the strategy switch itself then can determine
  // if it wants to maintain what was being changed previously or do something else

  // Perhaps a better alternative here is to have the session maintain the modelStatePatch, i.e. the patch that applies to the project
  // model, and is therefore non-transient

  // Another alternative - strategy pickers live outside of this (but as part of the interaction / strategy process), and that is the
  // part that determines if the next strategy should replace or append commands

  // Major benefit of maintaining either the accumulated commands or model patch is that we can present the final result to the user
  // and give them the option to cancel some parts of that without undoing the entire interaction
  // Sean:
  // The above is predicated on the commands setting discrete values and/or not changing something on another element at the same time.
