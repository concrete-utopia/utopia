          </h1>

          <p>
            Weâ€™re looking for experienced <b style={{ backgroundColor: 'white' }}>core engineers</b>{' '}
            to join us on our journey. If any of these are you, weâ€™d love to hear from you: perhaps
            youâ€™ve contributed to Chrome or another browser, React or another declarative UI
            library, maybe youâ€™ve built something that makes use of the Typescript AST, or worked on
            code editors, linters, parsers, lexers, or anything deeply technical that excited you.{' '}
          </p>

          <p>
            Weâ€™re also looking for a{' '}
            <b style={{ backgroundColor: 'white' }}>lead creative engineer</b>. Perhaps you have
            experience with creative coding, declarative animations, physics engines, visual
            scripting languages like Max MSP or Origami, or web audio. Perhaps youâ€™ve done work with
            physics-based layout systems, or constraint-based animations. Or youâ€™ve worked along the
            limits of building delightful experiences on low-powered devices, or built
            next-generation web technologies like Houdini.{' '}
          </p>

          <p>
            And weâ€™re looking for a <b style={{ backgroundColor: 'white' }}>product designer</b>.
            You are comfortable decomposing and recomposing complex and complicated problems, read
            code fluently, and have a portfolio of product design work. This is an abstract yet
            super hands-on role: you will think, create, build, and ship. Speed and taste are both
            essential.
          </p>

          <p>
            Youâ€™ll all be joining a small, international, fully distributed and pretty synchronous
            team where everyone works on everything. Weâ€™re a super welcoming group with no egos, an
            absurd sense of humour, and some of the best music recommendations in the industry.
            <br />
            If youâ€™re comfortable hanging out on Slack or Discord, hopping on a screensharing
            session, and love making things, weâ€™re your jamâ€¦ or your money back ðŸ˜Š{' '}
