              <Paragraph>
                Weâ€™re looking for experienced <b>core engineers</b> to join us on our journey. If
                any of these are you, weâ€™d love to hear from you: perhaps youâ€™ve contributed to
                Chrome or another browser, React or another declarative UI library, maybe youâ€™ve
                built something that makes use of the Typescript AST, or worked on code editors,
                linters, parsers, lexers, or anything deeply technical that excited you.{' '}
              </Paragraph>

              <Paragraph>
                Weâ€™re also looking for a <b>lead creative engineer</b>. Perhaps you have experience
                with creative coding, declarative animations, physics engines, visual scripting
                languages like Max MSP or Origami, or web audio. Perhaps youâ€™ve done work with
                physics-based layout systems, or constraint-based animations. Or youâ€™ve worked along
                the limits of building delightful experiences on low-powered devices, or built
                next-generation web technologies like Houdini.{' '}
              </Paragraph>

              <Paragraph>
                And weâ€™re looking for a <b>product designer</b>. You are comfortable decomposing and
                recomposing complex and complicated problems, read code fluently, and have a
                portfolio of product design work. This is an abstract yet super hands-on role: you
                will think, create, build, and ship. Speed and taste are both essential.
              </Paragraph>

              <Paragraph>
                Youâ€™ll all be joining a small, international, fully distributed and pretty
                synchronous team where everyone works on everything. Weâ€™re a super welcoming group
                with no egos, an absurd sense of humour, and some of the best music recommendations
                in the industry.
                <br />
                If youâ€™re comfortable hanging out on Slack or Discord, hopping on a screensharing
                session, and love making things, weâ€™re your jamâ€¦ or your money back ðŸ˜Š{' '}
