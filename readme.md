# Welcome to Utopia üèù

Utopia is an integrated design and development environment for React. It uses React code as the source of truth, and lets you make real time changes to components by editing it and using a suite of design tools. It's early software, but you can [try it today](https://utopia.app/project), look at an [example project](https://utopia.app/p/36ae27be-welcome-to-utopia/), or read about it on our [blog](https://utopia.app/blog)!

# For contributors: Installing Utopia on your machine

Utopia is browser-based. To run it locally, clone the repo, and then set up the server and webpack by following these instructions.

‚ö†Ô∏è We're looking into M1 related issues for some folks, but have it running successfully on three machine

## Prerequisites

- **If using Windows** you'll first need to set up the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (wsl)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). All following steps and commands will assume you are using the wsl.
- On **macOS** you need [brew](https://brew.sh/) and must run `brew install gmp` first. On new M1 Macbooks please follow [these steps](https://github.com/concrete-utopia/utopia#m1-macbook) to install brew and run the server the first time.
- [nix-shell](https://nixos.org/download.html). If you are on macOS Catalina or later, you will be prompted to include an extra flag in the install script. If using Windows follow [this guide](https://nathan.gs/2019/04/12/nix-on-windows/). If you don't want to use nix, we have instructions [here](https://github.com/concrete-utopia/utopia#running-this-without-nix)
- Recommended: [direnv](https://github.com/concrete-utopia/utopia#using-direnv-to-make-your-life-easier). If you don't have `direnv` installed, you'll need to run `nix-shell` before any of the `start` commands, and switching to nix will be a bit slower.

## Contributing and Bug Reporting

We welcome contributions. Utopia is a big project, but we're here to help, and are happy to pair up with you. The easiest way is to file an issue, or reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/NEEnPKCgzC). Please read our [contributing](contributing.md) doc to get started

# Run the Editor

There are a few different options for running Utopia below, but for all of them you'll head to [localhost:8000/p](https://localhost:8000/p) when developing the editor, or [localhost:8000](https://localhost:8000/) when developing the website itself.

Before you do anything, you'll need to build VS Code:

```
build-vscode
```

## Dev Mode: slower performance, full error messages, easier to debug

```
start
```

and in a second terminal, for typescript compile errors

```
watch-tsc
```

## Fast Mode: fast performance, minified react errors

Run everything in _fast_ mode, performance is fast, react will throw minified errors:

```
start-performance
```

and in a second terminal, for typescript compile errors

```
watch-tsc
```

## Run everything in _hot and brittle_ mode.

> it's the same as start but webpack is in hot mode (under the hood it runs npm run move-fast-and-break-things-hot instead of npm run move-fast-and-break-things). I've been using this for the last 4-5 days or so. hot mode still works if you are working on for example the inspector design. the canvas is pretty brittle to hot updates, every 4th update made my canvas turn white but for the purposes of the inspector tweaking it was fine

```
start-hot-only-ui-work
```

## Run each part separately

(each series of commands assumes that you're starting from the root directory of the project)

### Running the server:

Shell 1:

```
nix-shell
redis-server
```

Shell 2:

```
nix-shell
watch-server
```

If this ever fails with `truncated tar archive`, it's a cabal failure. The fix appears to be to delete `~/.cabal/packages`

### Running the editor in dev mode (slow but you see react errors)

Shell 3:

```
nix-shell
watch-tsc
```

Shell 4:

```
nix-shell
watch-editor-cowboy
```

### Running the editor in fast mode

Shell 5:

```
nix-shell
watch-tsc
```

Shell 6:

```
nix-shell
watch-editor-performance
```

Alternatively you can run `npm run webpack-production`. Occasionally you'll need to run `npm install` from the `/editor` directory before webpack.

### Running webpack with the website

Shell 7:

```
nix-shell
watch-website
```

### Build editor vscode

```
build-vscode-with-extension
watch-vscode-dev
```

### Finally, loading the running application

Now the editor should load on [localhost:8000/p](https://localhost:8000/p)

## Pull request bundle support.

When a series of environment variables are set (see `Branches.hs`), the editor supports the ability to get a bundle of editor code from S3 that was created from a PR, and load that instead of the code currently held locally. Which means that changes can be tested without spinning up multiple environments.

To use this if the URL currently is `https://utopia.pizza/p/e976df60-phase-rutabaga/`, the branch name would be added on in a query parameter like so: `https://utopia.pizza/p/e976df60-phase-rutabaga/?branch_name=my-test-branch`.

Limitations:

- Doesn't currently support Monaco because of the way that builds the workers in a special webpack plugin, so changes to the version of Monaco in that branch may fail in unusual ways.
- Anything that isn't editor code will not be changed by this, such as the website code or the server endpoints.

# Troubleshooting

## M1 Macbook

There are some extra steps to build server files, steps 11-14 are also needed when there are dependency changes for the server.

1. Open Applications, locate the Terminal within the Utilities folder
2. Select Terminal.app and right-click on it then ‚ÄúDuplicate‚Äù
3. Rename the duplicated Terminal app to ‚ÄòRosetta Terminal‚Äô
4. Now select the new renamed ‚ÄòRosetta Terminal‚Äô, right-click and choose ‚ÄúGet Info‚Äù
5. Check the box for ‚ÄúOpen using Rosetta‚Äù, then close the Get Info window
6. Run the Rosetta Terminal
7. Type `arch` first to make sure your terminal is good, this should show `i386` in the Rosetta Terminal
8. Install homebrew there, please add `arch -x86_64` before pasting the install script
9. Install gmp with `arch -x86_64 /usr/local/bin/brew install gmp`
10. Close with cmd+q, open a normal Terminal and install direnv and nix-shell as the [description](https://github.com/concrete-utopia/utopia#prerequisites), then come back for the final 4 steps
11. Run the Rosetta Terminal again
12. Enter the utopia folder, `direnv` and run the `start-website-server` to build the server files here
13. After you see a message about `Startup Processes Completed` exit terminal with cmd+q
14. Open a normal Terminal, run the `start` script in the utopia folder.

## fsevents

If you notice that 1 or more CPU cores are running 100% because of `node` processes, it is probably webpack-dev-server having trouble with `fsevents` on MacOS. To fix it, run `npm install fsevents` in the `utopia/editor` directory. see https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/701#issuecomment-216082726

## Running this without Nix

You'll need four things running concurrently:

```
editor/npm run webpack
editor/npx tsc --watch
Website/npm start
server/cabal new-run --disable-optimization --disable-profiling --disable-documentation --disable-library-coverage --disable-benchmarks utopia-web -- +RTS -N

```

## Using direnv to make your life easier

Since a lot of this requires using `nix-shell` everywhere, you can just use [direnv](https://direnv.net/) to make that a lot simpler. Not only will this automatically use a nix shell whenever you `cd` into the project folder, but it also adds caching to vastly speed up the opening of that shell. You can install direnv by using [brew](https://brew.sh/):

```
brew install direnv
```

To actually run direnv you need to hook it into your shell by following the instructions [here](https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html).

Then to configure it, in your \$HOME directory add a file `.direnvrc` with the following contents (copied from https://github.com/direnv/direnv/wiki/Nix#using-a-global-use_nix-with-garbage-collection-prevention):

```
use_nix() {
  local path="$(nix-instantiate --find-file nixpkgs)"

  if [ -f "${path}/.version-suffix" ]; then
    local version="$(< $path/.version-suffix)"
  elif [ -f "${path}/.git" ]; then
    local version="$(< $(< ${path}/.git/HEAD))"
  fi

  local cache=".direnv/cache-${version:-unknown}"

  local update_drv=0
  if [[ ! -e "$cache" ]] || \
    [[ "$HOME/.direnvrc" -nt "$cache" ]] || \
    [[ .envrc -nt "$cache" ]] || \
    [[ default.nix -nt "$cache" ]] || \
    [[ shell.nix -nt "$cache" ]];
  then
    [ -d .direnv ] || mkdir .direnv
    nix-shell --show-trace --pure "$@" --run "\"$direnv\" dump bash" > "$cache"
    update_drv=1
  else
    log_status using cached derivation
  fi
  local term_backup=$TERM path_backup=$PATH
  if [ -n ${TMPDIR+x} ]; then
    local tmp_backup=$TMPDIR
  fi

  eval "$(< $cache)"
  export PATH=$PATH:$path_backup TERM=$term_backup TMPDIR=$tmp_backup
  if [ -n ${tmp_backup+x} ]; then
    export TMPDIR=${tmp_backup}
  else
    unset TMPDIR
  fi

  # `nix-shell --pure` sets invalid ssl certificate paths
  if [ "${SSL_CERT_FILE:-}" = /no-cert-file.crt ]; then
    unset SSL_CERT_FILE
  fi
  if [ "${NIX_SSL_CERT_FILE:-}" = /no-cert-file.crt ]; then
    unset NIX_SSL_CERT_FILE
  fi

  # This part is based on https://discourse.nixos.org/t/what-is-the-best-dev-workflow-around-nix-shell/418/4
  if [ "$out" ] && (( $update_drv )); then
    local drv_link=".direnv/drv"
    local drv="$(nix show-derivation $out | grep -E -o -m1 '/nix/store/.*.drv')"
    local stripped_pwd=${PWD/\//}
    local escaped_pwd=${stripped_pwd//-/--}
    local escaped_pwd=${escaped_pwd//\//-}
    ln -fs "$drv" "$drv_link"
    ln -fs "$PWD/$drv_link" "/nix/var/nix/gcroots/per-user/$LOGNAME/$escaped_pwd"
    log_status renewed cache and derivation link
  fi

  if [[ $# = 0 ]]; then
    watch_file default.nix
    watch_file shell.nix
  fi
}
```

And add a `.envrc` file to the root folder of the project with the following contents:

```
use nix
```

(This file is deliberately contained in the `.gitignore` because it is supposed to be personal to you - it allows you to add custom environment variables that will always be in scope whenever you're in this directory)

Please update your .zshrc (or .bashrc) to [hook it into the shell](https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html), for example for zsh add this line:

```
eval "$(direnv hook zsh)"
```

After this step open a new shell window and enter the utopia directory. Direnv should be activated as soon as you enter, you can use the `start` and `start-performance` scripts without manually running nix-shell.

## Unit Tests with Jest

One-off test run:

```
npm run test
```

Continuous mode:

```
npm run test-watch
```

On macOS, when trying to watch, you might run into an error message about number of open files. In that case, install watchman:

```
brew install watchman
```

## VSCode linting, formatting with prettier etc

To enable format-on-save, you should install the VSCode plugin `esbenp.prettier-vscode`, and `dbaeumer.vscode-eslint` and then in your workspace settings, enable format on save, and tell prettier to use the eslint integration mode:

```
  "eslint.workingDirectories": ["./editor", "./utopia-api"],
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "prettier.useEditorConfig": false,
  "prettier.requireConfig": true,
  "[typescript]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
  },
  "[javascript]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
  },
  "[typescriptreact]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
  },
  "[json]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
  }

```

Select prettier as the default formatter in your settings; VSCode may prompt you to do so. The last four line items, starting with `[typescript]` reflect this. You should restart VSCode after this.

# Deploying

All pushes to the `master` branch will immediately trigger [this](.github/workflows/master-pushes.yml) workflow that runs the tests and then triggers a deploy to our Staging environment.

To deploy to the Production environment, somebody needs to manually trigger our [`tag-release.yml`](.github/workflows/tag-release.yml) workflow, giving either a specific commit hash or branch name (defaulting to `master`), and optionally a tag name (the default behaviour is to increment the patch version). This can be triggered via the "Run Workflow" button [here](https://github.com/concrete-utopia/utopia/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Tag+and+Release%22)  
**Note**: in the "Use workflow from" dropdown you have to select "Branch: master" - this is specifying which workflow to run, not which branch to cut the release from.
