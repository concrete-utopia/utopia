      <h1>Momentumworks Inc / Utopia's Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and GDPR policy</h1>
      <p>
        Hi and welcome! You're reading Utopia’s Terms of Service, which include an agreement between
        you and Momentumworks Inc in Section 15 to arbitrate in certain cases instead of going to
        court.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the legal contract between you and Momentumworks Inc when you use the Utopia site,
        and related services and products. You should read this carefully before you use our site,
        our services or products.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’ve tried to be both fair and clear—if you have any suggestions for improvement, feel free
        to email us at <a href='mailto:support@utopia.app'>support@utopia.app</a>. We’ve also
        included annotations throughout this contract in quotes; these annotations aren’t a part of
        the contract itself, but are intended to help you follow the text and to emphasize key
        sections.

        by the parties; (y) the arbitrator may award injunctive or declaratory relief only in favor
        of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief
        warranted by that party’s individual claim; and (z) any judgment on the award rendered by
        the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding
        anything in this Agreement, (1) either party may seek remedies in small claims court of
        competent jurisdiction and (2) either party may seek injunctive or other equitable relief in
        any court of competent jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any claims brought by you or us must be brought in that party’s individual capacity, and not
        as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. Neither
        you nor us will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims
        covered by these Agreement. You hereby waive any and all rights to bring any claims related
        to these Agreement and/or our Privacy Policy as a plaintiff or class member in any purported
        class or representative proceeding. You may bring claims only on your own behalf.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may opt out of the agreement to arbitrate in the first paragraph of this Section 13
        (“Agreement to Arbitrate”). If you do so, neither you nor we can require the other to
        participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify us in writing within
        thirty (30) days of the date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision.
        The opt-out notice must state that you do not agree to the Agreement to Arbitrate and must
        include your name, address, phone number, your Account to which the opt-out applies and a
        clear statement that you want to opt out of this Agreement to Arbitrate. You must sign the
        opt-out notice for it to be effective. This procedure is the only way you can opt out of the
        Agreement to Arbitrate. You must use this address to opt out:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Momentumworks Inc ATTN: Arbitration Opt-out Los Angeles, California, CA USA</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you and we agree that if we
        make any change to the arbitration procedures (other than a change to any notice address or
        Site link provided herein) in the future, that change shall not apply to any claim that was
        filed in a legal proceeding against us prior to the effective date of the change. Moreover,
        if we seek to terminate the arbitration procedures from this Agreement, such termination
        shall not be effective until thirty (30) days after the version of this Agreement not
        containing the arbitration procedures is posted to our Services, and shall not be effective
        as to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against us prior to the effective date
        of removal.
      </p>
      <p>
        In accordance with Section 12, this Section will survive the termination of your
        relationship with us.

      <h2>15. Special Provisions for users Located Outside of the United States</h2>
      <h3>“We’re in the United States, so we’ll follow U.S. law.”</h3>
      <p>
        Momentumworks Inc provides global products and services and enables a global community for

        following provisions apply specifically to users located outside of the United States: (1)
        you consent to the transfer, storage, and processing of your information, including but not
        limited to User Content and any personal information, to and in the United States and/or
        other countries; and (2) if you are using the Services from a country embargoed by the

        of any further rights hereunder. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be

        extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and
        enforceable. This Agreement is not assignable, transferable, or sublicensable by you except
        with Momentumworks Inc’s prior written consent. Momentumworks Inc may assign this Agreement

      <h2>1. Children</h2>
      <h3>“We do not collect personally identifiable information from children.”</h3>
      <p>
        The Services are not directed towards, and Momentumworks Inc does not knowingly collect
        information from, children under the age of thirteen (13). If you are a parent and believe
        your child under the age of thirteen (13) has created a Services account or otherwise
        provided personal information to Momentumworks Inc, please contact us at{' '}
        <a href='mailto:support@utopia.app'>support@utopia.app</a>.
      </p>
      <h2>2. What This Privacy Policy Covers</h2>
      <h3>“This Policy covers information you share with Momentumworks Inc, not third parties.”</h3>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of information gathered when you are using or
        accessing the Services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties
        that we do not own or control, including but not limited to any third party websites,
        services and applications (“Third Party Services”) that you elect to access through the
        Service or to individuals that we don’t manage or employ. We encourage you to carefully
        review the privacy policies of all Third Party Services you access.
      </p>
      <h2>3. What Information We Collect and How We Use It</h2>
      <h3>
        Information Obtained from Third Party Services: “Momentumworks Inc uses your data shared
        from third-party networks like Twitter and you should understand their policies.”
      </h3>
      <p>
        Information about Your Accounts on Third Party Services: Key parts of the Services require
        you to link your Account to certain Third Party Services, including without limitation
        social networking services such as GitHub. In order to do so, you will provide your user ID
        and authentication on each of those Third Party Services, where we receive a token that
        allows us to access those accounts. We use this authorization as permission to, for example,
        retrieve your content or activity on those services.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do NOT ask for, receive or store your passwords for your Third Party Service accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
        We really encourage you to familiarize yourself with the terms of service and privacy policy
        of any Third Party Services which you use in conjunction with Utopia.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some cases, when you connect your Account with your accounts on Third Party Services, we
        may obtain information about you from those Third Party Services. To the extent we obtain
        such information, we may use the information about you that we receive from Third Party
        Services to improve and personalize our Services. As a general practice, we strongly urge
        you to make careful judgments about any personal information you disclose to Internet
        services, including without limitation Utopia and any Third Party Services, regardless of
        whether you choose to link your accounts.
      </p>
      <h3>User Content: “Your Utopia activity is public by default.”</h3>
      <p>
        By default, the information we get from your accounts with Third Party Services and the
        analysis generated by the Services regarding that information is public, and it is published
        so that anyone can view it. If you use our Services to edit your profile or content, that
        edit will become public and our Services will publicly show that you made the edit. You
        should assume that anything Utopia publishes for you is publicly accessible unless you have
        explicitly selected otherwise. Content published and shared publicly is accessible to
        everyone, including without limitation search engines. In addition, information shared
        publicly may be copied and shared throughout the Internet. While you are free to remove
        published content from or delete your Account, because of the nature of Internet sharing,
        copies of that content may exist elsewhere and be retained indefinitely, including without
        limitation in our systems.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Information About User Content: “Your content might have data embedded in it. We may use
        that data.”
      </h3>
      <p>
        In some cases, we may collect information about content you provide to the Services. For
        example, when it’s included with images, we may collect information describing your camera
        and camera settings. This information allows us to improve the Services and provide
        additional features and functionality.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Information Related to Use of the Services: “We use third party statistics and analytics
        services. Read their policies.”
      </h3>
      <p>
        We collect information about how people use the Services, including without limitation those
        with an Account. This information includes general usage information, and may include
        information such as the number and frequency of our visitors, which pages or features of the
        Services they have visited, which links on the Services they have clicked on, and the length
        of those visits. We may also use third party applications and services, such as Google
        Analytics, to collect and analyze this information. This information enables us and third
        parties authorized by us to figure out how often individuals use the Services so that we can
        analyze and improve them. Some of this information may be associated with the IP Address (as
        defined below) used to access the Services, and some may be associated with your Account,
        such as the topics you search for and the help pages that you visit. We may also use some of
        this information in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure related to all of our
        users that would not identify you personally. We use information about your use of the
        Services to improve and enhance your experience on the Services.

      <h3>
        Information Related to Your Web Browser: “Web browsers typically send some data when you
        visit us; We use that to make Utopia better.”
      </h3>
      <p>
        We automatically receive and record information from your web browser when you interact with
        the Services, such as your browser type and version, what sort of device you are using, your
        operating system and version, your language preference, the website or service that referred
        you to the Services, the date and time of each web request you make, your screen display
        information, and information from any cookies we have placed on your web browser (as
        described below). We also sometimes detect whether you are using certain web browser
        extensions and store that information in a manner associated with your Account. Web
        browser-related information is used to enhance your experience with the Services (for
        example, by personalization) and to allow us to improve the Services; it is not, however,
        used in a manner that would identify you personally.
      </p>
      <h3>
        IP Address Information: “Normally, when you visit Utopia we receive your IP address, which
        we’ll use to improve Utopia.”
      </h3>
      <p>
        When you log into the Services or load a web page from the Services, we will collect and
        store your Internet Protocol Address (“IP Address”). We generally use IP Address information
        to fight spam, malware, and identity theft; we also may use it, in the future, to
        personalize the Services for you. IP Address information is also used by us to generate
        aggregate, non-identifying, information about use of the Services.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Location Information: “If we receive your location information, we’ll use it to provide
        better Utopia services to you.”
      </h3>
      <p>
        In some cases we collect and store information about where you are located, such as by
        converting your IP Address into a rough geolocation, or by using location data stored in
        photos or in social media messages. We may use location information to improve and
        personalize the Services for you.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Information Collected Using Cookies: “We use cookies to make Utopia work for you. If you
        turn them off, you won’t be able to use Utopia. Some statistics services we use set cookies,
        too.”
      </h3>
      <p>
        Cookies are pieces of information that may be sent to and saved by your web browser when you
        access a website; your web browser stores these cookies in a way associated with each
        website you visit, and you can see your cookies through your browser settings. We use
        cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you use
        the Services. Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain information that personally
        identifies you, and we don’t combine the general information collected through cookies with
        other information to tell us who you are. However, we do use cookies to identify that you
        have logged in and that your web browser has accessed aspects of the Services, and we may
        associate that information with your Account if you have one. This information, in turn, is
        sometimes used to personalize your experiences on the Services, such as by presenting you
        with a different feature when you are logged in to Utopia. Most web browsers have an option
        for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new
        cookies, as well as (depending on your web browser software) allowing you to decide to
        accept each new cookie in a variety of ways. If you disable cookies, you won’t be able to
        log into your Account, and so will not be able to use the vast majority of our Services; as
        such, we don’t recommend disabling your cookies when using the Services. Some third-party
        services that we use, such as Google Analytics, may also place their own cookies on your
        browser. Note that this Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the
        use of cookies by third parties.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals as there
        is no industry standard for compliance. We do not track you across the internet, and we do
        not change or disable the DNT setting in your browser.

      <h3>
        Information About Your Contacts: “Utopia may automatically retrieve your friend or follower
        list from connected services.”
      </h3>
      <p>
        Certain features of the Services allow you to provide us with your contact lists stored on
        other services. We only use and store that information to provide the Utopia service to you.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Derived Information: “We may deduce information about you from your activity. We only do
        that to provide Utopia services to you.”
      </h3>
      <p>
        We analyze your actions on the Services in order to derive or infer characteristics that may
        be descriptive of you. These characteristics are used to improve and personalize the
        Services.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Email Tracking: “We may sometimes put a tracking link in emails to know if you opened an
        email or clicked on a link in it.”
      </h3>
      <p>
        We may place information in our emails to you (such as a web beacon) that allows us to
        measure our email deliverability, and we may track which links in an email are followed. We
        may also use third-party email services to deliver messages and you should review the
        policies of these services which govern these messages as well.
      </p>
      <h2>4. Remarketing</h2>
      <h3>“You may see more advertising for Utopia when you browse the web.”</h3>
      <p>
        In the future, we may use marketing services provided by Google and other third parties that
        allow us to deliver advertising to users after they leave our Services that they will see
        elsewhere on the web. This is a common practice called “remarketing.” Users will not see
        more ads than they otherwise would see as a result of remarketing; rather, the ads they see
        are more likely to be ads for Utopia products and services. Google (and any other third
        party marketing services providers we use to help us with remarketing) use cookies as part
        of the remarketing service. For more information regarding remarketing and the ability to
        opt-out, please visit:

      <h3>“We don’t share your personal information without telling you.”</h3>
      <p>
        We never share personal information we receive from you unless: (a) we have your permission
        to share that information; (b) we have given you prior notice (such as within this privacy

        operating and improving the Services. For example, we may share information with service
        providers in order to fight spam, and third-party consultants may have access to information
        in the process of improving our processes and technology. Agents with whom we share such
        information for these reasons are generally bound by confidentiality obligations and, unless
        we tell you differently, our Agents do not have any right to use information we share with

      <h2>GDPR</h2>
      <h2>EFFECTIVE DATE OF AMENDMENT: Feb 28, 2019.</h2>
      <p>
        Momentumworks Inc, (Processor) provides products and/or services involving the processing
        (ex. accessing, storing, transmitting, etc.) of personal data subject to the GDPR
        (collectively, the “Agreements”). Accordingly, Momentumworks Inc, is acting as processor
        and/or subprocessor under GDPR.
      </p>
      <p>
        This Amendment shall apply to all processing of personal data in order to provide the
        Services under all Agreements. This amends the Agreement(s) to reflect the arrangements
        between Processor and its Customers for General Data Privacy Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”) as
        follows:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1. Definitions.</strong>
        <br />
        All capitalized terms not specifically defined in this GDPR Letter Amendment shall have the
        same meaning as provided for in the Agreement(s). Terms used but not defined in this Section
        1 (Definitions), such as “processing”, “controller”, “processor” and “data subject”, will
        have the same meaning as set forth in Article 4 of the GDPR.
      </p>
      <p>The following definitions are used within this GDPR Letter Amendment:</p>
      <p>
        1.1 Data Protection Laws means the GDPR and all Member State data protection laws and
        regulations.
      </p>
      <p>
        1.2 Customer Personal Data means the Personal Data which Processor is processing as
        Processor on behalf of Customer in order to provide the services. Personal Data includes
        both, Personal Data controlled by Customer and Personal Data Customer is Processing on
        behalf of Other Controllers as Processor.
      </p>
      <p>
        1.3 Other Controller means any entity other than Customer that is Controller of the Customer
        Personal Data, such as Customer's affiliated companies or Customer's client's, their
        customers or affiliated companies.
      </p>
      <p>
        1.4 Personal Data Breach means a suspected or actual breach of security leading to the
        accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access
        to, Personal Data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>2. Roles and Scope.</strong>
        <br />
        2.1 This GDPR Letter Amendment applies if and to the extent Processor is Processing Customer
        Personal Data. Customer appoints Processor as Processor to process such Customer Personal
        Data.
      </p>
      <p>
        2.2 Processor will Process Customer Personal Data for the sole purpose of providing the
        Services according to Customer's written instructions. The initial scope of Customer's
        instructions for the Processing of Customer Personal Data is defined by the Agreements
        including, in particular, this GDPR Letter Amendment. Customer may provide further
        instructions that the Processor has to comply with. In case Processor does not accommodate
        an instruction, Customer may terminate the affected part of the Service by providing
        Processor with a written notice. If Processor believes an instruction violates the Data
        Protection Laws, Processor will inform Customer without undue delay.
      </p>
      <p>
        2.3 Processor will comply with all Data Protection Laws in respect of the services
        applicable to Processors and is responsible for the lawfulness of Processor's Processing of
        Customer Personal Data.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>3. Relevant GDPR Obligations: Articles 28, 32, and 33.</strong>
        <br />
        3.1 Processing by Processor shall be governed by this GDPR Letter Amendment under European
        Union or Member State law and are binding on Processor with regard to Customer. The
        subject-matter and duration of the processing, the nature and purpose of the processing, the
        type of Personal Data, the categories of data subjects and the obligations and rights of
        Customer are set forth in the Agreements in place between the parties, including this GDPR
        Letter Amendment. In particular, Processor shall:
      </p>
      <p>
        3.1.1 process the Personal Data only on documented instructions from Customer, including
        with regard to transfers of Personal Data to a third country or an international
        organization, unless required to do so by Union or Member State law to which Processor is
        subject; in such a case, Processor shall inform Customer of that legal requirement before
        processing, unless that law prohibits such information on important grounds of public
        interest;
      </p>
      <p>
        3.1.2 ensure that persons authorized to process the Personal Data have committed themselves
        to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality;
      </p>
      <p>3.1.3 take all measures required pursuant to Article 32 of the GDPR;</p>
      <p>
        3.1.4 respect the conditions referred to in Section 3.1 and Section 4 for engaging another
        processor;
      </p>
      <p>
        3.1.5 taking into account the nature of the processing, assist Customer by appropriate
        technical and organizational measures, insofar as this is possible, for the fulfilment of
        Customer's obligation to respond to requests for exercising the data subject's rights laid
        down in Chapter III of the GDPR;
      </p>
      <p>
        3.1.6 assist Customer in ensuring compliance with the obligations pursuant to Articles 32 to
        36 of the GDPR, taking into account the nature of processing and the information available
        to Processor;
      </p>
      <p>
        3.1.7 at the choice of Customer, delete or return all the Personal Data to Customer after
        the end of the provision of services relating to processing, and delete existing copies
        unless Union or Member State law requires storage of the Personal Data;
      </p>
      <p>
        3.1.8 make available to Customer all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with
        the obligations laid down in Article 28 of the GDPR and as described in this GDPR Letter
        Amendment and allow for and contribute to audits, including inspections, conducted by
        Customer or another auditor mandated by Customer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Processor shall immediately inform Customer if, in its opinion, an instruction infringes the
        GDPR or other Union or Member State data protection provisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4. Subprocessors.</strong>
        <br />
        4.1. The engagement of Subprocessors (including Processor Affiliates) by Processor requires
        Customer's explicit prior written approval. The fact that Customer has agreed to the
        involvement of a respective subcontractor regarding the provision of Services, cannot be
        considered as an approval for such subcontractor to Process Customer Personal Data as
        Subprocessor. Processor will provide a list of its then-current Subprocessors for Customer's
        review upon execution of this GDPR Letter Amendment, and Processor notify Customer in
        advance of any changes to Subprocessors and request Customer's explicit approval for such
        change.
      </p>
      <p>
        4.2. Processor shall impose the same data protection obligations as set out in this DPA on
        any approved Subprocessor prior to the Subprocessor Processing any Customer Personal Data,
        and ensure that the relevant obligations (including but not limited to the information and
        audit rights) can be directly enforced by Customer or Other Controllers against the
        Processor's Subprocessors.
      </p>
      <p>
        4.3. Processor remains responsible for its Subprocessors and liable for their acts and
        omissions as for its own acts and omissions and any references to Processor's obligations,
        acts and omissions in this DPA shall be construed as referring also to the Processor's
        Subprocessors.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>5. Technical and Organizational Measures.</strong>
        <br />
        Processor shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a
        level of security appropriate to the risk, including but not limited to:
        <br />
        5.1. the pseudonymisation and encryption of Personal Data;
      </p>
      <p>
        5.2. the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and
        resilience of processing systems and services;
      </p>
      <p>
        5.3. the ability to restore the availability and access to Personal Data immediately in the
        event of a physical or technical incident; and
      </p>
      <p>
        5.4. a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of
        technical and organizational measures for ensuring the security of the processing.
      </p>
      <p>
        5.5. Additional technical and security measures are as set forth in Exhibit 1 of this GDPR
        Letter.
      </p>
      <p>
        5.6. If changes to the technical and organizational measures are required by Customer, such
        changes shall be implemented by the Processor following Customer's instructions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          6. In assessing the appropriate level of security, account shall be taken of the risks
          that are presented by processing, in particular from accidental or unlawful destruction,
          loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to Personal Data transmitted,
          stored or otherwise processed.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          7. Processor shall take steps to ensure that any natural person acting under the authority
          of Processor who has access to Personal Data does not process them except on instructions
          from Customer, unless he or she is required to do so by Union or Member State law.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>8. Breach Notification.</strong>
        <br />
        Processor shall notify Customer without undue delay (and in no event less than 24 hours)
        after becoming aware of a Personal Data Breach. Such notice will, at a minimum:
      </p>
      <p>
        8.1. describe the nature of the personal data breach including where possible, the
        categories and approximate number of data subjects concerned and the categories and
        approximate number of Personal Data records concerned;
      </p>
      <p>
        8.2. communicate the name and contact details of the data protection officer or other
        contact where more information can be obtained;
      </p>
      <p>8.3. describe the likely consequences of the personal data breach; and</p>
      <p>
        8.4. describe the measures taken or proposed to be taken by the controller to address the
        personal data breach, including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible
        adverse effects.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>9. Assisting Customer Response to Requests from Data Subjects.</strong>
        <br />
        9.1. To the extent permitted by law, Processor will inform Customer without undue delay of
        requests from Data Subjects exercising their Data Subject rights (e.g. rectification,
        deletion and blocking of data) addressed directly to Processor regarding Customer Personal
        Data. If Customer is obliged to provide information regarding Customer Personal Data to
        Other Controllers or third parties (e.g. Data Subjects or the Supervisory Authority),
        Processor shall assist Customer in doing so by providing all required information. If
        Customer or Other Controllers are obliged to provide information about the processing of
        Customer Personal Data to a Data Subject, Processor shall assist Customer in making the
        required information available.
      </p>
      <p>
        9.2. If a Data Subject brings a claim directly against Customer for damages suffered in
        relation to Processor's breach of this GDPR Letter Agreement or Data Protection Laws with
        regard to the processing of Customer Personal Data, Processor will indemnify Customer for
        any reasonable cost, charge, damages, expenses or loss arising from such a claim, provided
        that Customer has notified Processor about the claim and is giving the Processor the
        possibility to cooperate with Customer in the defense and settlement of the claim.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>10. Transborder Data Processing.</strong>
        <br />
        10.1. In case Processor is established in a country that is neither a Member State nor
        considered by the European Commission to have adequate protection, by agreeing to this GDPR
        Letter Amendment, Processor is entering into EU Standard Contractual Clauses with Customer
        as set out here
      </p>
      <p>
        10.2. At Customer's choice, Other Controller(s) may agree to the EU Standard Contractual
        Clauses as additional Data Exporter(s) and Processor declares in advance to accept such
        accession. Customer shall inform the Processor about the accession of such additional Data
        Exporters.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>11. Records of Processing Activities.</strong>
        <br />
        Processor shall maintain all records required by Article 30(2) of the GDPR and, to the
        extent applicable to the processing of Personal Data on behalf of Customer, make them
        available to Customer upon request.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>12. General.</strong>
        <br />
        Processor agrees that it shall be responsible for all costs associated with its compliance
        of such obligations. Processor is responsible and liable for its acts and omissions under
        this DPA. All damages arising under this GDPR Letter Amendment shall be deemed direct
        damages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Except as amended herein, all other terms and conditions of the subject Agreement(s) shall
        remain in full force and effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Customer acknowledges that they have read this GDPR Letter Amendment, understand it, and
        agree to be bound by its terms and conditions. Further, they agree that this GDPR Letter
        Amendment and the subject Agreement are the complete and exclusive statement of the
        agreement between the parties, superseding all proposals or other prior agreements, oral or
        written, and all other communications between the parties relating to this subject.
      </p>
      <h2>Exhibit 1</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Technical and Organizational Measures</strong>
        <br />
        Processor has implemented and will maintain the appropriate technical and organizational
        security measures in accordance with either option a) Independent Attestation of Security,
        or b) GDPR Data Security Principles, for the purpose of protecting Customer or Personal Data
        (collectively, “Customer Personal Data,”) against accidental loss, destruction, alteration,
        unauthorized disclosure or access, or unlawful destruction. Processor agrees that, based on
        Customer or Customer Client requirements or the nature of the engagement, Customer may
        require Processor to agree to additional technical and organizational measures. Those terms
        may require a separate executed agreement.
      </p>
      <h2>GDPR Data Security Principles</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>1. Data Protection</strong>
        <br />
        a. Security measures for each Processor deliverable or service are designed to protect
        Customer Personal Data and to maintain the availability of such Customer Personal Data
        pursuant to the Agreement, including applicable Attachments, Statements of Work or other
        transaction documents, (collectively “Agreement Documents”). Customer is the sole controller
        for any personal data, and appoints Processor as a processor to process such personal data
        (as those terms are defined in EU General Data Protection Regulation). Processor will treat
        all Customer Personal Data as confidential by not disclosing Customer Personal Data except
        to Processor employees, contractors, and subprocessors, and only to the extent necessary to
        deliver the Service, unless otherwise specified in Agreement Documents.
      </p>
      <p>
        b. Processor will securely sanitize physical media intended for reuse prior to such reuse,
        and will destroy physical media not intended for reuse, consistent with National Institute
        of Standards and Technology, United States Department of Commerce (NIST), guidelines for
        media sanitization.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>2. Security Policies</strong>
        <br />
        a. Processor will maintain and follow IT security policies and practices that are integral
        to Processor's business and mandatory for all Processor employees, including supplemental
        personnel.
      </p>
      <p>
        b. Processor will review its IT security policies at least annually and amend such policies
        as Processor deems reasonable to maintain protection of Services and Customer Personal Data
        processed therein.
      </p>
      <p>
        c. Processor will maintain and follow its standard mandatory employment verification
        requirements for all new hires, including supplemental employees, and extend such
        requirements to wholly owned Processor subsidiaries. In accordance with Processor internal
        process and procedures, these requirements will be periodically reviewed and include, but
        may not be limited to, criminal background checks, proof of identity validation, and
        additional checks as deemed necessary by Processor. Each Processor company is responsible
        for implementing these requirements in its hiring process as applicable and permitted under
        local law.
      </p>
      <p>
        d. Processor employees will complete security and privacy education annually and certify
        each year that they will comply with Processor's ethical business conduct, confidentiality,
        and security policies, as set out in Processor's employee code of conduct. Additional policy
        and process training will be provided to persons granted administrative access to Service
        components that is specific to their role within Processor's operation and support of the
        Service, and as required to maintain compliance and certifications stated in the relevant
        Agreement Documents.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>3. Security Incidents</strong>
        <br />
        a. Processor will maintain and follow documented incident response policies consistent with
        NIST guidelines for computer security incident handling, and will comply with data breach
        notification terms of the Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        b. Processor will investigate unauthorized access and unauthorized use of Customer Personal
        Data of which Processor becomes aware (security incident), and, within the Service scope,
        Processor will define and execute an appropriate response plan. Customer may notify
        Processor of a suspected vulnerability or incident by submitting a technical support case
        for Processor evaluation.
      </p>
      <p>
        c. Processor will promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours) notify Customer of a
        security incident or Personal Data Breach that is known or reasonably suspected by Processor
        to affect Customer. Processor will provide Customer with reasonably requested information
        about such security incident and status of any Processor remediation and restoration
        activities.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4. Physical Security and Entry Control</strong>
        <br />
        a. Processor will maintain appropriate physical entry controls, such as barriers, card
        controlled entry points, surveillance cameras, and manned reception desks, to protect
        against unauthorized entry into Processor facilities used to host the Service (data
        centers). Auxiliary entry points into data centers, such as delivery areas and loading
        docks, will be controlled and isolated from computing resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        b. Access to data centers and controlled areas within data centers will be limited by job
        role and subject to authorized approval. Use of an access badge to enter a data center and
        controlled areas will be logged, and such logs will be retained for not less than one year.
        Processor will revoke access to controlled data center areas upon a) separation of an
        authorized employee or b) the authorized employee no longer has a valid business need for
        access. Processor will follow formal documented separation procedures that include, but are
        not limited to, prompt removal from access control lists and surrender of physical access
        badges.
      </p>
      <p>
        c. Any person duly granted temporary permission to enter a data center facility or a
        controlled area within a data center will be registered upon entering the premises, must
        provide proof of identity upon registration, and will be escorted by authorized personnel.
        Any temporary authorization to enter, including deliveries, will be scheduled in advance and
        require approval by authorized personnel.
      </p>
      <p>
        d. Processor will take precautions to protect the Service's physical infrastructure against
        environmental threats, both naturally occurring and man-made, such as excessive ambient
        temperature, fire, flood, humidity, theft, and vandalism.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>5. Access, Intervention, Transfer and Separation Control</strong>
        <br />
        a. Processor will maintain documented security architecture of networks managed by Processor
        in its operation of the Service. Processor will separately review such network architecture,
        including measures designed to prevent unauthorized network connections to systems,
        applications and network devices, for compliance with its secure segmentation, isolation,
        and defense in depth standards prior to implementation. Processor may use wireless
        networking technology in its maintenance and support of the Service and associated
        components. Such wireless networks, if any, will be encrypted and require secure
        authentication and will not provide direct access to Service networks. Service networks do
        not use wireless networking technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        b. Processor will maintain measures for a Service that are designed to logically separate
        and prevent Customer Personal Data from being exposed to or accessed by unauthorized
        persons.
      </p>
      <p>
        c. To the extent described in the relevant Agreement Documents, Processor will encrypt
        Customer Personal Data not intended for public or unauthenticated viewing when transferring
        Customer Personal Data over public networks and enable use of a cryptographic protocol, such
        as HTTPS, SFTP, and FTPS, for secure transfer of Customer Personal Data to and from the
        Service over public networks.
      </p>
      <p>
        d. Processor will encrypt Customer Personal Data at rest when specified in Agreement
        Documents. If the Service includes management of cryptographic keys, Processor will maintain
        documented procedures for secure key generation, issuance, distribution, storage, rotation,
        revocation, recovery, backup, destruction, access, and use.
      </p>
      <p>
        e. If Processor requires access to Customer Personal Data, Processor will restrict and limit
        such access to least level required to provide and support the Service. Such access,
        including administrative access to any underlying components (privileged access), will be
        individual, role based, and subject to approval and regular validation by authorized
        Processor personnel following the principles of segregation of duties. Processor will
        maintain measures to identify and remove redundant and dormant accounts with privileged
        access and will promptly revoke such access upon the account owner's separation or request
        of authorized Processor personnel, such as the account owner's manager.
      </p>
      <p>
        f. Consistent with industry standard practices, and to the extent natively supported by each
        component managed by Processor within the Service, Processor will maintain technical
        measures enforcing timeout of inactive sessions, lockout of accounts after multiple
        sequential failed login attempts, strong password or passphrase authentication, and measures
        requiring secure transfer and storage of such passwords and passphrases.
      </p>
      <p>
        g. Processor will monitor use of privileged access and maintain security information and
        event management measures designed to a) identify unauthorized access and activity, b)
        facilitate a timely and appropriate response, and c) to enable internal and independent
        third party audits of compliance with documented Processor policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        h. Logs in which privileged access and activity are recorded will be retained in compliance
        with Processor's records retention policy. Processor will maintain measures designed to
        protect against unauthorized access, modification and accidental or deliberate destruction
        of such logs.
      </p>
      <p>
        i. To the extent supported by native device or operating system functionality, Processor
        will maintain computing protections for systems containing Customer Personal Data and all
        end-user systems that include, but may not be limited to, endpoint firewalls, full disk
        encryption, signature based antivirus and malware detection and removal that shall a) be
        regularly updated by central infrastructure and b) logged to a central location, time based
        screen locks, and endpoint management solutions that enforce security configuration and
        patching requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>6. Service Integrity and Availability Control</strong>
        <br />
        a. Processor a) performs penetration testing and vulnerability assessments, including
        automated system and application security scanning and manual ethical hacking, before
        production release and annually thereafter, b) enlists a qualified independent third-party
        to perform penetration testing at least annually, c) performs automated management and
        routine verification of underlying components' compliance with security configuration
        requirements, and d) remediates identified vulnerabilities or noncompliance with its
        security configuration requirements based on associated risk, exploitability, and impact.
        Processor will take reasonable steps to avoid Service disruption when performing its tests,
        assessments, scans, and execution of remediation activities.
      </p>
      <p>
        b. Processor will maintain policies and procedures designed to manage risks associated with
        the application of changes to its Services. Prior to implementation, changes to a Service,
        including its systems, networks and underlying components, will be documented in a
        registered change request that includes a description and reason for the change,
        implementation details and schedule, a risk statement addressing impact to the Service and
        its clients, expected outcome, rollback plan, and documented approval by authorized
        personnel.
      </p>
      <p>
        c. Processor will maintain an inventory of all information technology assets used in its
        operation of the Service. Processor will continuously monitor the health and availability of
        the Service and underlying components.
      </p>
      <p>
        d. Each Service will be separately assessed for business continuity and disaster recovery
        requirements pursuant to documented risk management guidelines. Each Processor Service will
        have, to the extent warranted by such risk assessment, separately defined, documented,
        maintained and annually validated business continuity and disaster recovery plans consistent
        with industry standard practices. Recovery point and time objectives for the Service, if
        provided, will be established with consideration given to the Service's architecture and
        intended use, and will be described in the relevant Agreement Documents.
      </p>
      <p>
        e. Processor will a) backup systems containing Customer Personal Data daily, b) ensure at
        least one backup destination is at a remote location, separate from production systems, c)
        encrypt backup data stored on portable backup media and d) validate backup process integrity
        by regularly performing data restoration testing.
      </p>
      <p>
        f. Processor will maintain measures designed to assess, test, and apply security advisory
        patches to the Service and its associated systems, networks, applications, and underlying
        components within the Service scope. Upon determining that a security advisory patch is
        applicable and appropriate, Processor will implement the patch pursuant to documented
        severity and risk assessment guidelines. Implementation of security advisory patches will be
        subject to Processor change management policy.
