          Today we’re announcing the alpha version of Utopia, a design and coding environment for
          React projects and components that runs in the browser. It combines VSCode with a design
          and preview tool, and full two-way synchronisation:{' '}
          <b>design and code update each other, in real time</b>. And unlike any design tool out
          there, it uses React code as the source of truth.

        <Paragraph>
          We built Utopia to combine the speed of design tools with the power of code. And we wanted
          to do this so that it works with real code, in real projects. Recent years have seen an
          explosion in better collaboration tooling, handover tooling, code export, prototyping
          plugins. But all too often they also add complexity, increase brittleness, and introduce
          more failure points.{' '}
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          Utopia is different. Ultimately, designs are only as good as what was actually shipped! So
          we asked ourselves the question: if that’s the goal, why not start there? The result is a
          product that reads, runs, understands, and manipulates production-level React code. No
          “code export” that doesn’t follow your conventions, no bulk rewrites, and no diffs. And
          most importantly, we made it safe: whatever Utopia doesn’t (yet) understand, it leaves
          as-is.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          We wanted Utopia to be incredibly fast and easy to pick up. Part of this is making it feel
          natural - bringing behaviours, features, and keyboard shortcuts you already have muscle
          memory for. And since Utopia is an editor - not a library, not a framework - you can use
          (and learn!) vanilla Javascript and React. If you have a preferred way of styling your
          components, managing state, or splitting your code across files, it’ll work.{' '}
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          In its simplest form, you can use it as an online coding playground for React projects,
          and include custom assets, and external packages and component libraries via node. To edit
          the code, we included VSCode, Microsoft’s open source code editor - complete with ESLint,
          Prettier, theme support. There’s a console for debugging, an external preview for sharing
          your creations with the world, and runtime error messages. And there’s a canvas that lets
          you render one or many components, and that updates as-you-type.{' '}
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          Utopia’s superpowers really come to the fore once you switch the canvas into edit mode.
          Every element and component on the canvas becomes selectable, configurable, and editable.
          We had ambitious objectives here, and in particular wanted to create a tool that was
          familiar, powerful, and also adapted to the unique challenge of editing real,
          production-grade code. Here are some of the ways in which this works:
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          <b>Follow me lets you stay in sync:</b> Utopia defaults to a “follow me” mode, where
          clicking on an element in the design automatically opens up the file, scrolls to the right
          place, and places the cursor. And this works the other way around as well!
        </Paragraph>

          <Video src='https://archipelago.utopia.app/follow-me-loop-1.mp4' />
        </GhostBrowser>
        <Paragraph>
          <b>Components are first class concepts.</b> Utopia was built from the ground up to work
          with nested components that can be configured via props. For instance, you can quickly
          switch between seeing the instance of one to editing the component itself, in place,
          without context switching.
        </Paragraph>
        <GhostBrowser className='max-w-4xl mx-auto mb-10'>

        </GhostBrowser>
        <Paragraph>
          <b>Working with generated and conditional content:</b> Real UIs aren’t just “powered by
          data”, but frequently generated from them. And they contain a lot of conditionally
          rendered content. Utopia handles generated and conditional content with relative ease, and
          understands what “source” they refer back to. For conditions, you can see where they
          apply, toggle them manually, and make the changes you want.{' '}
        </Paragraph>

        </GhostBrowser>
        <Paragraph>
          <b>Layouts with real CSS:</b> We built Utopia to deal with real layouts. This includes not
          only layout systems like Flexbox / Autolayout, but also content-driven sizing, and
          cascades of nested block-level elements you find in many components.{' '}
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          <b>Code-aware design:</b> Frequently, parts of your UI are populated by variables and
          function calls. That’s passed-in style props, colours and backgrounds picked from a theme,
          or conditionally applied text colours. For some of these, we already have tools built in
          to edit them. And for all of them, our editor understands they’re there, clearly calls
          them out to you, and even lets you quickly override them. Or jump directly to the code.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          <b>Designing with real css:</b> CSS-based layouts are a far cry from absolutely positioned
          boxes in a global layout system you find in most design tools. Elements size themselves
          based on their content, content may overflow or get cut off, and layout systems like
          Flexbox or Grid are everywhere. While these ways of dealing with layouts are more scalable
          and adaptable, they also make for a pretty slow and unintuitive design experience. To get
          around this, we built new tools that take the spirit of “just grab the box and drag it”
          but made it fit for real-life layout systems. And we added dozens of little conveniences
          to make working with multi-level nested layouts more intuitive.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          How ready is Utopia? The coding playground side of Utopia works well, and we’ve been using
          it internally to prototype and experiment with parts of the editor itself! The design tool
          is still quite early, but we’d love to see what you can do with it. Our ambition is to
          give the React community the fastest way to get from idea to production-grade code, and
          our roadmap for the remainder of the year includes a lot of improvements to the design and
          build experience.{' '}
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          To make that ambition a reality, we have one more thing to share: Utopia is an
          open-source, MIT-licensed software project hosted on Github. If you’re interested in
          connecting design and code, want to contribute and discuss ideas about anything from
          product-centric colour pickers to ideas for visually manipulating data flows, or are
          excited about real-time code manipulation, we’d love to hear from you (whether you write
          code or not!). Play with Utopia, check out Github, and join our Discord.{' '}
